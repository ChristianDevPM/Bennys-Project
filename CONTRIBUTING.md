# Contributing to Cue Time Solutions

Thanks for your interest in Cue Time Solutions â€” a project originally developed as part of a university capstone. While we are not currently seeking active contributions from the public, some of the original development team members have expressed interest in continuing this project to explore its potential as a tool for local pool and billiard halls.
