# Benny's Pool Time System - Code Repository

📂 **Path:** `Bennys-Project/src/`  

This folder contains development files for **Benny's Pool Time System**.

## 📜 Contents:
- **`.gitkeep`** – Placeholder file to keep the directory in version control.
- **`Bennys.sql`** – SQL script to create the database structure for the system.
- **`Test app.py`** – Python mock-up of the application for early testing.
